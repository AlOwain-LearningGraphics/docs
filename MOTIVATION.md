# MOTIVATION

In this markdown, I will summarize all I have learned throughout my journey of learning more about the graphics pipeline. My interest in this project is to learn more about how graphics are rasterized. My purpose throughout this is not to create projects that could showcase my skill. In fact quite the opposite, I will specifically use this to test vulnerabilities in my programming skills in specific areas I find myself lacking. All software I write through this was only written as practice; the software WILL probably be incomplete, messy, and underdeveloped. I do not recommend you use this software as a serious assesment of my programming skills or as a learning tool, most of the things you will read will be messy, unstructured, and they probably won't make sense. For your sake don't spend too much time trying to understand my reasons in using certain methods and not others, I am a beginner in all this, I am not writing optimal or even good software in this project.
