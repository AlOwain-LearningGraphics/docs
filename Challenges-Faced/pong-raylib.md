# Pong - 21/11/2023

### Description

This is a journal I will maintain to document the challenges I have faced in my journey through learning graphics. I have started writing this journal as a way to assemble and reflect on the lessons I have learned; to anyone on a similar journey I really recommend recurring reflection on your progress. Improving often goes unnoticed, and as such unappreciated. Very often you hear programmers facing (Imposter Syndrome)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor\_syndrome], well why? I certainly am not a human psychology expert but I believe I can reflect on my own thoughts and experiences, sharing what I have learned. I would suggest that the ambiguity of progress especially in the programming field shrouds your achievements and gained experiences. Programming often requires a lot of grunt work that doesn't really decrease with a gain in knowledge; as kids go through learning arthemtics they move from calculating equations using their fingers or abacuses to simply running them in their heads. The improvements in their abilities quickly reflect on their speed. Programming however doesn't really allow for that speed up, or for any tangible easily and noticable effect on your programming ability with experience, you always face challenges that you haven't had any similar experience with, it always gets you through the valley of despair (not knowing what you are doing and feeling foolish and incapable) to the high mountains of satisfaction as if you conquered the field you are learning in, only to repeat the cycle elsewhere (otherwise it gets boring).

As such reflection is truly an important ability to learn going through this endeavor. A year seems too short for the amount I've learned in it, and that grounds me which allows me to pursue learning more and more.

### My choice of projects

Developing Pong is arguably the "Hello World" of making games, as rendering a teapot is for learning graphics. My choice of starting by making Pong and not through rendering a teapot is a conscious decision to avoid doing repetitive work while being put in an uncomfortable environment where you know nothing about the thing you are doing, I have tried going through the teapot and making your own engine route but I quickly found myself uninterested in pursuing it further than rendering a triangle. Well I don't blame the teapot, I blame myself for taking it up too early, building interest in a subject is the quickest way to get someone to actually pursue it. As such I prefer going to learn first through games using libraries that ease everything on me (RayLib in this example), getting satisfaction through a low effort project will help maintain my progress in learning more step by step.

### The challenges

Developing Pong really was not challenging at all. I used it to (sort of) get comfortable in the development environment I am using, setting up Vim and learning more about C++, Makefiles, and basic trignometry, although I have some basic information about all of these subjects, Pong really helped me learn more about every subject it touched.

### Notes about the journal

I have started writing this journal at the day I started working on building Tetris in RayLib, I suppose to a certain degree I did that to avoid working on Tetris but nevertheless, I believe it isn't such a bad idea
